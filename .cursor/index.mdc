# Rule Type: Always
- Before acting, read `buglog.csv` if it exists; if not, create it with the header.
- When the task involves a bug or fix:
  - reference prior rows by short_id/area/files
  - after proposing a patch, output ONE CSV row to append to `buglog.csv` (use ISO timestamp)
- Never create extra docs; stick to current stack and minimal diffs.
